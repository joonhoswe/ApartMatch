  <h2> Introduction </h2>
  <p> ApartMatch is an online platform that streamlines the dreaded college off-campus room search. Gone are the days of scrolling for hours through outdated and scam-filled Facebook housing groups or Reddit threads. Finding houses with rooms left is extremely simple when a website can show in <em> real-time </em> how many rooms are available. </p>
